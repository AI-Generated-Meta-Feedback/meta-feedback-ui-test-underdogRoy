insertion sort. 
Reason:
1.Library staff reshelve books as they arrive.
2.datasets 25 books are small.
3.books have been partially sorted.
Insertion sort is stable.
sorting strategy
shelfnumber compare, when shelfnumber is equal, compare return order
complexity
O(n^2)=25^2=625 in worst case
if already sorted it's O(n)
